      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>
        On this website you can see the magic and emotions that are experienced
        when practicing water rafting, you will find my ideas and opinions about
        this sport and some tips to always stay safe and continue enjoying.
        Since I was little I have liked the water and I feel that I am part of
        it, for that reason I have wanted to share with you the moments that I
        have lived practicing rafting, and I also want to infect you with this
        desire to put fear aside practicing this sport. You will have a great
        experience, you just have to follow all the precautions and guidance of
        the experts and you will see how exciting it is to live this experience.

      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>
        This website is aimed at all people who are fascinated by extreme
        sports, who enjoy feeling that adhrelin run through their entire body.
        Many of the people I want to target with this project are those between
        the ages allowed by law to practice any of these sports, and this age
        can be, but is not limited to, from 16 to 60 years old. An audience is
        also contemplated whose interest may be limited to spending a good time
        with friends and loved ones, or those who are looking for a moment of
        distance from reality or simply for those who want to have a good photo
        or a good memory.

        The Site Map of a site is just like it sounds…it is a map of the pages
        in a site and how they are related and linked together. From the map
        above we can see that we will eventually have the Home page and 2 sub or
        child pages.
      </p>
      <p>
        The lines that connect them all together indicate that each page should
        be accessible from any other page, it is essentially showing us the
        global navigation for the site.

      <h2>
        Wireframes
      </h2>
      <p>
        Wireframes are like blueprints for making webpages. They should show the
        major sections of content that will be on the page and the relative
        locations of each element. In the wireframe below you can see there will
        be 6 sections to our page:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          At the top we have a section with the logo (the box with the mountain
          means an image) and the navigation bar.
        </li>
        <li>
          Then there is a banner image that stretches all the way across the
          screen.
        </li>
        <li>Next we have some text and an image</li>
        <li>...followed by another row made up of an image and some text.</li>
        <li>Then one more section of text with no image.</li>
        <li>
          Lastly, a footer containing a copyright/name line and 3 social media
          icons.
        </li>
      </ol>
