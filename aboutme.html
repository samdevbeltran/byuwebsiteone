        Hi friends! I'm Samuel Beltran, but you can call me Sam :), I'm from
        Colombia. I've been member of the church since I was little and served
        my mission in the California-Fresno Mission.

        My brother and I are making a comic, which is published on a web site
        comic, and we love to work on it, also I like to watch movies, read,
        spend time with family and friends, travel and read.
      </p>

        I studied "software development" here in Colombia but I want to keep learning and know
        that this course can help me improve my skills.
